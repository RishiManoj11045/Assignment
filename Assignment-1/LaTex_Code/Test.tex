\textbf{Q4(a):}
What must be subtracted from $16x^3-8x^2+4x+7$ so that the resulting expression has $2x+1$ as a factor?\\
\textbf{Solution:}
Let $p(x)=16x^3-8x^2+4x+7$ and $d(x)=2x+1$.\\
Polynomial division of $p(x)$ with $d(x)$:\\
\\
$\polylongdiv{16x^3-8x^2+4x+7}{2x+1}$
\\
\\
From the above division, it is clear that 1 has to be subtracted from the polynomial $p(x)$, so that $d(x)$ becomes factor of the resulting polynomial after subtraction.
